    "# Solving Frozen Lake With Q-Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we'll implement q-learning on a simple discrete environment called Frozen Lake. Here is what the documentation says about Frozen Lake:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Winter is here. You and your friends were tossing around a frisbee at the park when you made a wild throw that left the frisbee out in the middle of the lake. The water is mostly frozen, but there are a few holes where the ice has melted. If you step into one of those holes, you'll fall into the freezing water. At this time, there's an international frisbee shortage, so it's absolutely imperative that you navigate across the lake and retrieve the disc. However, the ice is slippery, so you won't always move in the direction you intend.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The surface is described using a grid like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "SFFF       (S: starting point, safe)\n",
    "FHFH       (F: frozen surface, safe)\n",
    "FFFH       (H: hole, fall to your doom)\n",
    "HFFG       (G: goal, where the frisbee is located)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> The episode ends when you reach the goal or fall in a hole. You receive a reward of 1 if you reach the goal, and zero otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The documentation on OpenAI is infuriatingly sparse, but the environments and API is incredibly helpful. Get used to digging around in the [source code](https://github.com/openai/gym/blob/master/gym/envs/toy_text/frozen_lake.py) if you want to fully understand the environments. For example, the source indicates which actions are which:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "LEFT = 0\n",
    "DOWN = 1\n",
    "RIGHT = 2\n",
    "UP = 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And this is what they mean when they say the \"ice is slippery\":\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ...\n",
    "# Code above is nested for loops to address each state/action pair \n",
    "if is_slippery:\n",
    "    for b in [(a-1)%4, a, (a+1)%4]:\n",
    "        newrow, newcol = inc(row, col, b)\n",
    "        newstate = to_s(newrow, newcol)\n",

    "    rew = float(newletter == b'G')\n",
    "    li.append((1.0, newstate, rew, done))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This line is the most important one: `[(a-1)%4, a, (a+1)%4]`. It indicates that taking an action might result in one of three actions being taken, and what those actions could be. Consider `left=0`: you have a 1 in 3 chance each of actually going left, up, or down. Because:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "0-1 % 4 = 3 => UP\n",
    "0+1 % 4 = 1 => DOWN\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When the ice is slipperty every action might send you in one of the two perpindicular directions. Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "LEFT  ->  LEFT, UP, DOWN\n",
    "RIGHT ->  RIGHT, UP, DOWN\n",
    "UP    ->  UP, LEFT, RIGHT\n",
    "DOWN  ->  DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT\n",

    "Q-learning is an algorithm that iteratively explores an environment in order to experimentally approximate the Bellman equation: \n",

    "\n",
    "With Q-Learning, we have our agent switch between \"exploring\" the state space and \"exploiting\" the optimal policy (at least, our current notion of that policy). The below is an example of an \"epsilon greedy\" Q-learning algorithm, which means some percent of the time our agent picks an action at random, and the rest of the time it picks whatever our current \"optimal\" action is, defined by the Q-Table. We define an \"exploration rate\" to control how often the agent explores at random, this exploration rate is often denoted by the symbol epsilon (Îµ), hence \"epsilon greedy\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Every time our agent takes an action, we will update our Q-Table, which contains an entry for every state-action pair that our agent encounters. We initialize this table to be 0 for all state-action pairs. Additionally, Q-Learning introduces a \"learning rate\" which is similar to the learning rate in Stochastic Gradient Descent. "
